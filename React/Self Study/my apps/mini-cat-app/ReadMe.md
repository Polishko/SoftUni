This is a mini app where I practiced my new learnings. It is a small cat shelter game where you can add cats (simply choose a name for the newly arrived cat and a random image will be attached). When you are finished adding new cats, close the form and the manage button for each cat will be activated. Here you can feed the cats and clean their litter to make them happy. You can also adopt them. The shelter info container shows how many cats are in the shelter currently and how many have been adopted. When all cats are adopted, you get a message that celebrates you. I am just learning about useEffect and I still need to correct the dependency of the adopted cats count. This needs to reset when all cats are adopted without resetting the browser. I will add this feature later.
